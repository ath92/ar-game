## mArble

mArble is a mobile augmented reality game, developed as part of the `Design project` course at Universit√© Paris-Sud, where I studied Human Computer Interaction.

Players use printed tokens that represent virtual puzzle pieces. The tokens must be rearranged so that the virtual pieces line up correctly. The player can then cause a Marble to start rolling on one of the pieces. If all pieces are positioned correctly, the marble touches all pieces, after which it reaches its final goal, and the player has solved the level.
